### This is a replica of a goated game called Ticket to Ride ~~Europe~~ London :D

its still in workings, but hopefully ill finish it.

Try it out at https://ttrlondon.aregus.me

To use this locally you have to download the project and stuff, and do npm install + npm build + npm start.

I might add an AI agent soon, so keep updated to add ur envs after updating the project locally

Also, AI has been used to create mechanics related to the game, a lot of things have been written by hand, i just suck at logic and math :<
